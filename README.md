### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Group project to create a game using Phaser3.


### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

- Collaborating using Git and GitHub.
- Create a BADASS game!

### :grimacing: Description:

We decided to create an endless runner game. Randomly generating platforms ranging between different heights, widths, and lenghts. Also randomly generating three different enemies on the platforms. The runner collects coins while avoiding enemies trying to get the highest possible score. The user can choose between three different characters and three different maps. 

Building the game gave us great learnings working with Phaser 3. Including building and working with scenes, working with arcade physics, custom classes, creating backgrounds and character animations with spritesheets, designing in Figma and coding it in JavaScript.
